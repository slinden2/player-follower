# player-follower

The web app allows the used to follow his favorite NHL players and see their stats from the most recent game nights. The app uses the free official [NHL Stats API](https://statsapi.web.nhl.com/api/v1/teams). The stats are fetched every night after the last game is concluded.

The unofficial API documentation can be found [here](https://gitlab.com/dword4/nhlapi).

The repository is structured so that development versions of backend and frontend can be found in their respective directories in the root of the repository. The `web` directory contains the current version of the application deployed in [Heroku](https://nameless-refuge-44259.herokuapp.com/).
